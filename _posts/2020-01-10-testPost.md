前天戏谑兽用双黄连遭疯抢的时候，一个朋友透露了另一个事实更让我新奇：中国民间的猫奴，在黑市上采买代号为GS-441524的核苷化合物，用来治疗猫恶性传染病猫传腹已有个把年头了，效果奇好。GS-441524是什么呢，它是日前才在美国首例新冠患者身上成功抗击病毒的未上市药，名为Remdesivir的前体化合物。猫传腹的病原体是什么呢，是恶性突变的猫肠道冠状病毒。真可谓“兽药医用，医药兽用”，非常时期，管用的就是好药。另外如此看来，Remdesivir击退此次在人身上爆发的2019新冠状病毒，希望还是挺大的。
The ThorLabs LCVR is very easily damaged: if the beam does not go straight through it, you risk toasting. 
A damaged LCVR will produce slow responses, intensity gradients across tiles, etc. 
This fact is not noted in the ThorLab's manual for the device.
The damage occurs when a powerful laser beam hits or scatters onto the edges of the LCVR holder. 
The holder is located inside a rotation stage and is protected by an aperture with a radius smaller than that of the LCVR itself.  
The aperture is *not* sufficient to protect the LCVR from damage.
i.e. if the beam swipes across its surface during alignment, you risk damaging the unit. 
The only safe way to re-align the beam through the LCVR is as follows:

- Block off the beam entering the device.
- Close the shutter integrated in the aperture in front of the LCVR.
- Unblock the beam and align it so that it hits the middle of the closed shutter.
- Block the beam.
- Open the LCVR shutter. 
- Un-block the beam.

At this point you must leave untouched the beam upstream of the LCVR.
